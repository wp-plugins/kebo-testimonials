The easiest way to display and receive Testimonials on your website.

== Description ==

The hassle free design means you can get it working in minutes. Display Testimonials beautifully and compatible with responsive sites. Allow users to submit Testimonials using the handy Widget and Shortcode forms.

`
This plugin is still very early in its development, so you may experience
issues during use. While I cannot promise you will have no problems, I
will resolve problems quickly once identified.

Alternatively, give it a week or two and the rough edges will have been
fixed and the polish added.

= Spam Detection =

We offer three forms of spam detection, which will not impact users at all (no captcha). We will also be integrating the plugin with Akismet soon, to further improve the spam detection.

All submissions identified as Spam are marked with the 'Spam' status, so that they do not clutter the main list. You can then view them seperately and approve them if you choose.
