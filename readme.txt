= Spam Detection =

We offer three forms of spam detection, which will not impact users at all (no captcha). We will also be integrating the plugin with Akismet soon, to further improve the spam detection.

All submissions identified as Spam are marked with the 'Spam' status, so that they do not clutter the main list. You can then view them seperately and approve them if you choose.
